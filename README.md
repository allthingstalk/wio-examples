#libraries
The repository contains a folder labeled 'libraries'. Here you'll find all the required libraries that are used by the demo sketches. These libraries need to be installed in the arduino ide (or copied to the libraries folder).

#flashing
In case your wio node gets stuck (ex: you removed the cable while uploading and now it wont go into upload mode anymore), then you have to flash the device again. All the required files and tools can be found in the 'for flashing' folder.
